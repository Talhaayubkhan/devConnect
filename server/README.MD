# 🚀 DevConnect

**DevConnect** is a modern developer networking platform inspired by the concept of DevTinder. It enables developers to discover and explore each other's profiles, send and receive connection requests, and build professional relationships. Whether you're seeking collaboration, mentorship, or simply want to expand your dev network — DevConnect makes it seamless.

## 🎯 Key Features

- View detailed developer profiles
- Create and customize your own profile (skills, bio, etc.)
- Send, accept, or decline connection requests
- View your connections and explore others
- Secure login and registration with authentication
- Responsive user interface for mobile and desktop

---

## 🛠️ Project Overview

**DevConnect** is built with a clear separation of concerns:

- A frontend interface to interact with the platform
- A backend API to manage authentication, profiles, and connections
- A database to persist users and their relationships

The architecture promotes scalability, modularity, and clean code practices.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `client/` — React-based frontend
- `server/` — Node/Express backend
- `models/` — Database schemas
- `routes/` — API endpoints for auth, profiles, and connections
- `controllers/` — Logic for handling requests
- `middleware/` — Auth and validation logic

---

## 🚧 Getting Started

To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies in both `client` and `server` directories
3. Create a `.env` file in `server/` with:

   - `PORT`
   - `MONGO_URI`
   - `JWT_SECRET`

4. Start the backend and frontend separately

Make sure your MongoDB instance is running.

## 💡 Inspiration

The idea for DevConnect was inspired by platforms like DevTinder — but with a focus on professional development and meaningful connections among developers. It’s a space to showcase talent, find collaborators, and grow together.
